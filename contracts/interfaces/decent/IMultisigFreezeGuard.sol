/**
 * A specification for a Safe Guard contract which allows for multi-sig DAOs (Safes)
 * to operate in a fashion similar to [Azorius](../azorius/Azorius.md) token voting DAOs.
 *
 * This Guard is intended to add a timelock period and execution period to a Safe
 * multi-sig contract, allowing parent DAOs to have the ability to properly
 * freeze multi-sig subDAOs.
 *
 * Without a timelock period, a vote to freeze the Safe would not be possible
 * as the multi-sig child could immediately execute any transactions they would like
 * in response.
 *
 * An execution period is also required. This is to prevent executing the transaction after
 * a potential freeze period is enacted. Without it a subDAO could just wait for a freeze
 * period to elapse and then execute their desired transaction.
 *
 * See https://docs.safe.global/learn/safe-core/safe-core-protocol/guards.
